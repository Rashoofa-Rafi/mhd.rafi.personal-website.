As an Instrument Technician, I have gained hands-on experience in troubleshooting, calibration, and maintenance of a wide range of instruments and control systems. This knowledge has proven invaluable in my subsequent roles as an Electrical and Instrument Team Lead, where I oversaw teams, coordinated resources, and optimized workflows to deliver exceptional results.</p>
                <p class=" text-white fs-5 fst-italic">In my capacity as a Project Engineer, I honed my skills in project planning, risk assessment, and stakeholder management. I have a proven track record of successfully leading cross-functional teams, fostering collaboration, and driving project milestones. As a Project Manager, I excel in identifying project requirements, defining scopes, and implementing effective strategies to mitigate risks and ensure project success.</p>
